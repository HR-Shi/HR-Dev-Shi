# Golden Flow (The codebase MUST be able to do this with the utmost consistency and quality)
1. We offer HRs to set KPIs from our dropdown list (or their custom requirements)
2. Then we do surveys/assessments to measure those KPIs in real-time and as a whole
3. We get to the results of those surveys, plot them in a visually appealing fashion
4. Then we recommend the Action Plans for specific Focus groups (clusters) found in the results to build up
5. Then we measure the efficacy of the Action Plans, with the help of data-driven approaches
6. We show the honest results and recommendations to build on top of this result
7. Loop goes onâ€¦
