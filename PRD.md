# HR Dashboard Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

The HR Dashboard is a comprehensive business intelligence tool designed to centralise HR data, deliver actionable insights, and support strategic decision-making for human resource teams. It consolidates modules for employee engagement, satisfaction, survey management, action planning, and focus group analytics into a single, intuitive interface. This updated PRD introduces advanced features to enhance KPI tracking, survey deployment, real-time analytics, outlier identification, and AI-driven recommendations, ensuring HR teams can proactively address workforce challenges and measure the impact of their interventions. Additionally, it incorporates a robust performance management system to streamline reviews, foster continuous feedback, and align individual efforts with organisational goals.

## 2. Purpose and Objectives

The HR Dashboard aims to:

*   Provide real-time, actionable insights for HR decision-making.
*   Centralise HR data for efficiency, transparency, and compliance.
*   Support strategic HR initiatives with visual, interactive analytics.
*   Enable HR teams to define and track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) critical to organisational goals.
*   Facilitate dynamic employee feedback through pulse surveys integrated across multiple platforms.
*   Identify outliers within the employee base for targeted interventions.
*   Leverage AI to generate tailored action plan templates and measure their efficacy through data-driven approaches.
*   Incorporate robust performance management systems to streamline reviews, foster continuous feedback, and align individual efforts with organisational goals.

## 3. Navigation Structure

The existing navigation structure remains intact with a persistent left-side navigation bar, organized into color-coded sections for ease of access:

*   **Main**: Overview, Employees, Focus Groups
*   **Engagement**: Surveys (Baseline, Recurring, Custom, Insights, Archived), Questions
*   **Improvement**: Action Plans, Initiatives
*   **Support**: Help Centre, HR Policies

A user profile section at the bottom left displays the current user and team for context and quick access to account settings. New features will be integrated into relevant modules, with potential additions to the navigation bar as detailed below.
