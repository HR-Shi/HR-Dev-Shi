## üìã **WHAT THE GENERATOR CREATES**

### **Organizational Structure**
- **10 Realistic Departments**: Engineering, Product, Sales, Marketing, HR, Finance, Operations, Customer Success, Design, Data Science
- **200+ Employees** (configurable): Distributed across departments with realistic job titles and hierarchies
- **Manager-Employee Relationships**: 20% of employees as managers with 3-8 direct reports each

### **Performance Data**
- **35 Parameter Ratings**: Every employee rated on all 35 parameters by:
  - **Self-assessments** (typically higher ratings)
  - **Manager evaluations** (most critical)
  - **Peer reviews** (2-4 peers per employee)
- **Multiple Time Periods**: Historical data across 6-month periods
- **Realistic Evidence**: Behavioral anchors and specific examples for each rating

### **Advanced Analytics**
- **3 KPI Calculations**: FRLP, Innovation Velocity, and Collaborative Health automatically calculated
- **Performance Archetypes**: 
  - High Performers (15%) - ratings 4.0-5.0
  - Solid Performers (35%) - ratings 3.5-4.5
  - Average Performers (30%) - ratings 2.5-3.5
  - Developing Performers (15%) - ratings 2.0-3.0
  - Struggling Performers (5%) - ratings 1.0-2.5

### **AI-Powered Insights**
- **Risk Assessments**: Burnout indicators and performance concerns
- **Leadership Potential**: Readiness scores and development timelines
- **Development Recommendations**: Personalized growth plans with success metrics

### **Performance Reviews**
- **Quarterly Review Cycles**: Complete performance review data
- **Manager Feedback**: Realistic comments and ratings
- **Review Status Tracking**: Completed, in-progress, and scheduled reviews

## üõ†Ô∏è **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues**

**‚ùå Database Connection Failed**
- Check your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Ensure Supabase database is accessible
- Verify database credentials

**‚ùå Missing Dependencies**
```bash
pip install faker numpy asyncpg python-dotenv
```

**‚ùå Permission Errors**
- Ensure your database user has INSERT permissions
- Check Supabase RLS policies if enabled

**‚ùå Slow Performance**
- Large datasets (500+ employees) may take 5-10 minutes
- Consider running in smaller batches
- Monitor database connection limits

### **Performance Tips**
- **Start Small**: Test with 50 employees first
- **Monitor Resources**: Watch database CPU and memory usage
- **Batch Processing**: Large datasets are processed in chunks
- **Connection Pooling**: Script uses single connection for efficiency
