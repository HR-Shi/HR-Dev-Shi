2. Make sure your database is running (Supabase)

## 📊 SYSTEM STATUS

After setup, you can check system status:

```bash
# Get user statistics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/users/stats/summary

# Get your permissions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/users/me/permissions
```

## 🎉 WHAT'S NEXT?

1. **✅ Log in with super admin**
2. **✅ Test all functionality**
3. **✅ Create additional users if needed**
4. **✅ Configure your system settings**
5. **✅ Start using the HR dashboard**

## 🆘 STILL HAVING ISSUES?

If you're still having problems:

1. **Check the console output** from the setup script
2. **Verify your database connection**
3. **Make sure all services are running**
4. **Try the super admin account first**

The super admin account (`superadmin@company.com`) can bypass ALL permission checks and access everything!
